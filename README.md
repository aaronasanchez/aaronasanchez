- 👋 Hi, I’m Aaron Sanchez
- 👀 I’m interested in coding! I also enjoy martial arts and music!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python. I love how easy it is to use the language and I believe that Python will be one of the most widely used languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will help deepen my knowledge and understanding of software development and also help people.
- 📫 You can reach me at aarona.sanchez@outlook.com or you can shoot me a message on twitter @aarondaface
